## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

  group_by(neighbourhood)%>%

            mean_nights_rented = mean(availability_365))%>%

  geom_point()

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
Airbnb map
```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
register_google(key = "AIzaSyCx-A7DH5JDWRLgo3vfMuf5_uUzwp6oqZI", write = TRUE)
TC_map <- get_map(location = "twin cities, minnesota", zoom = 9)
ggmap(TC_map)+ 
  geom_point(data = joinedlistings, mapping = aes(longitude, latitude, alpha = 0.1, col = "red"))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
